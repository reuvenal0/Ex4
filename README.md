# Ex4 - Enhanced graphic spreadsheet
## üîç Overview
**The program is a graphical spreadsheet application in Java, supporting text, numbers, formulas, conditions (`IF`), and functions (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `average`), including a graphical user interface, error handling, and file save/load functionality.**

This is a solution for assignment 4: Final Assignment, in Introduction to Computer Science, 2025A at Ariel University, School of Computer Science.

This project is based on **Assignment 2** [(link to my solution for Ex2)](https://github.com/reuvenal0/Ex2.git), It expands upon the initial version by adding support for:
 - Conditional cells (using IF conditions).
 - Functions (min, max, sum, and average) for numerical calculations over a range of cells.
---


## üîë Key Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface for viewing and editing the spreadsheet.
- **Text, Numbers, and Formulas**: Basic cell data types including arithmetic formulas (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Cell References**: Support for cell references like `A1`, `B2`, enabling dynamic calculations.
- **Conditional Cells**: `IF` conditions with support for:
    - Comparison operators: `<`, `>`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`
    - Nested conditions and logical operations
- **Functions**: Calculation over a range of cells with:
    - `min`: Minimum value in a range (e.g., `=min(A0:C3)`)
    - `max`: Maximum value in a range (e.g., `=max(A0:C3)`)
    - `sum`: Sum of all values in a range (e.g., `=sum(A0:C3)`)
    - `average`: Average of all values in a range (e.g., `=average(A0:C3)`)
- **File I/O**: Save and load spreadsheet data, including all advanced functionalities.

## üîß Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Using the following commands: 
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/reuvenal0/Ex4.git
    ```
2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA or other Java IDE**:
    - Ensure you have JDK 11 or later installed.
3. **Build & Run**:
   - Run the GUI application by executing the `Ex2GUI` class.
---

## üöÄ Usage
- **Navigating the GUI**:
    - Click on a cell to select it.
    - Type to edit the selected cell.
    - Press `Enter` to save the cell content.
    - Use `Save` and `Load` buttons to persist data.
- **Adding Data**:
    - Enter text directly (e.g., `Hello`).
    - Enter numbers (e.g., `123`).
    - Use formulas with `=` prefix (e.g., `=A0+B0`).
    - Use conditions with `IF` (e.g., `=if(A0>10, High, Low)`).
    - Use functions for range calculations (e.g., `=sum(A0:C3)`).
---

## ü©π Error Handling
- **Circular dependency detection**: Identifies and alerts circular references.
- **Invalid Formula and Condition Detection**:
    - Invalid formula syntax (`ERR_FORM_FORMAT`)
    - Circular dependencies on formula (`ERR_CYCLE_FORM`)
    - Invalid conditions (`ERR_IF`)
    - Invalid functions (`ERR_FUNC`)
---

## üß™ Testing
The project includes comprehensive **JUnit tests** for all core functionalities, including:
- **Basic cell operations** (text, number, formula, condition, function).
- **Circular dependency detection**.
- **Formula evaluation** and **syntax error detection**.
- **Function calculations** over a range of cells.
- **condition evaluation** and **return expected results**.
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs.
- **File I/O operations** for save/load functionality (see the example file `Save_Load_Test.txt`).

## üìå Some Cells examples
### **Basic Cell Types**

1. **Number cell:**  
   ```123```

2. **Text cell:**  
   ```"Hello, World!"```
### **Formula Cells**

3. **basic arithmetic:**  
   ```=A0 + B2```

4. **multiple operations and parentheses:**  
   ```=(A0 + B2) * (C3 / D4) - 5```

### **Conditional (IF) Cells**

5. **Basic `IF` condition:**  
   ```=IF(A0>10, "High", "Low")```

6. **Nested `IF` condition (multiple conditions):**  
   ```=IF(B2<=5, "Small", IF(B2<=10, "Medium", "Large"))```

### **Function Cells**
7. **Simple function (sum of a range):**  
   ```=SUM(A0:A5)```

### **Circular dependency**
8. **Circular dependency example - formula cycle error::**  
    ```A0 == B0 + 5```  
    ```B0 == A0 - 3```

### **‚ùå Invalid values:**
**A few short examples of invalid data, which defined as errors, depending on their type:**
-  `=A1 +` *(missing second operand)*
-  `=min(A1)` *(Must specify a range)*
- `=if(A1>5,10)` *(Missing `false` case)*

## üß© My Class Structure
Here is a brief description of each class and its responsibility in the project:

1. **`SCell`** - Represents an individual cell in the spreadsheet. Determines the initial type of data (text, number, formula, condition, function) and provides methods for data manipulation.

2. **`Ex2Sheet`** - Implements the spreadsheet logic. Manages a 2D array of `SCell` objects, handles formulas, conditions, function evaluation, circular dependency detection, and file I/O operations.

3. **`Ex2GUI`** - Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the spreadsheet. Handles user input, cell selection and visualization.

4. **`CellEntry`** - Converts between string-based cell coordinates (e.g., `"A1"`) and numeric indices `(x, y)`. Ensures valid cell references.

5. **`Range2D`** - Represents a range of cells (e.g. `"A0:C3"`). Validates ranges and provides methods to access start and end indices.

6. **`Ex2Utils`** - Contains utility functions and constants for spreadsheet calculations, including predefined functions (`sum`, `average`, `min`, `max`) and error handling codes.

7. **`StdDrawEx2`** - Custom graphics library extending `StdDraw` for rendering the spreadsheet grid and handling graphical interactions.
